  Args:
    operations: A list of Operation objects to poll.

    operation_service: The service that can be used to get operation
      objects.
    resource_service: The service of the collection being mutated by
      the operations. If the operation type is not delete, this service
      is used to fetch the mutated objects after the operations are done.
    http: An HTTP object.
    batch_url: The URL to which batch requests should be sent.
    warnings: An output parameter for capturing warnings.
    errors: An output parameter for capturing errors.
    custom_get_requests: A mapping of resource names to requests. If
      this is provided, when an operation is DONE, instead of performing
      a get on the targetLink, this function will consult custom_get_requests
      and perform the request dictated by custom_get_requests.

      operations to reach the DONE state.

  Yields:
    The resources pointed to by the operations' targetLink fields if
    the operation type is not delete. Only resources whose
    corresponding operations reach done are yielded.
