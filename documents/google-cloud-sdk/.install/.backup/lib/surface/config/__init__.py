  """View and edit Cloud SDK properties.

  A configuration is a set of properties that govern the behavior of gcloud
  and other tools in the Cloud SDK. The SDK provides a configuration named
  `default` whose initial properties are set when you run the `gcloud init`
  command. You can create any number of additional named configurations using
  `gcloud init` or `gcloud config configurations create`, and switch between
  configurations using `gcloud config configurations activate`.

  gcloud supports several flags that have the same effect as properties in
  a configuration (for example, gcloud supports both the `--project` flag and
  `project` property). Properties differ from flags in that flags affect command
  behavior on a per-invocation basis. Properties allow you to maintain the same
  settings across command executions.

  For more information on configurations, see `gcloud topic configurations`.
