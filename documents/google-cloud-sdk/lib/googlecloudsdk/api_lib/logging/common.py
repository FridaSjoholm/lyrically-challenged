  """Fetches log entries.

  This method uses Cloud Logging V2 api.
  https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/api/introduction_v2

  Entries are sorted on the timestamp field, and afterwards filter is applied.
  If limit is passed, returns only up to that many matching entries.

  It is recommended to provide a filter with resource.type, and log_ids.

  If neither log_filter nor log_ids are passed, no filtering is done.

  Args:
    log_filter: filter expression used in the request.
    log_ids: if present, contructs full log names based on parent and filters
      only those logs in addition to filtering with log_filter.
    order_by: the sort order, either DESC or ASC.
    limit: how many entries to return.
    parent: the name of the log's parent resource, e.g. "projects/foo" or
      "organizations/123" or "folders/123". Defaults to the current project.

  Returns:
    A generator that returns matching log entries.
    Callers are responsible for handling any http exceptions.
