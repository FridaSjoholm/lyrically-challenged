"""The main command group for Cloud Pub/Sub.

Everything under here will be the commands in your group.  Each file results in
a command with that name.

This module contains a single class that extends base.Group.  Calliope will
dynamically search for the implementing class and use that as the command group
for this command tree.  You can implement methods in this class to override some
of the default behavior.
